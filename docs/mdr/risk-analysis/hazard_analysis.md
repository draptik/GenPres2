# Hazard Assessment Table Instructions

## How to Complete Your Hazard Assessment Table

Follow these guidelines to properly fill out each column in your hazard assessment table:

### **Hazard ID**
- Assign a unique identifier to each hazard (e.g., H001, H002, etc.)
- Use consistent numbering throughout your assessment

### **Hazard Description**
- Provide a clear, specific description of the hazard
- Include the source, activity, or condition that creates the risk
- Be concise but detailed enough for others to understand

### **Potential Harm**
- Describe the specific injury, illness, or damage that could occur
- Include both immediate and long-term consequences
- Consider impacts on people, property, and environment

### **Severity (1-5)**
Rate the potential consequence if the hazard occurs:
- **1 = Negligible**: Minor injury, no time off work
- **2 = Minor**: First aid treatment, short absence
- **3 = Moderate**: Medical treatment, lost time injury
- **4 = Major**: Serious injury, permanent disability
- **5 = Catastrophic**: Fatality or multiple serious injuries

### **Probability (1-5)**
Rate the likelihood of the hazard occurring:
- **1 = Very Unlikely**: Rare, may occur once in 10+ years
- **2 = Unlikely**: May occur once in 1-10 years
- **3 = Possible**: May occur once per year
- **4 = Likely**: May occur several times per year
- **5 = Very Likely**: Occurs regularly, multiple times per year

### **Initial Risk Level**
- Calculate: Severity Ã— Probability = Risk Score
- Classify the risk level:
  - **1-5**: Low Risk
  - **6-12**: Medium Risk
  - **13-20**: High Risk
  - **21-25**: Very High Risk

### **Risk Control Measures**
- List specific actions to reduce or eliminate the risk
- Follow the hierarchy of controls (eliminate, substitute, engineering, administrative, PPE)
- Include who is responsible and when controls will be implemented

### **Residual Risk Level**
- Reassess severity and probability after implementing controls
- Calculate the new risk score using the same formula
- Ensure residual risk is at an acceptable level

### **Verification Method**
- Describe how you will confirm controls are working effectively
- Include monitoring frequency and responsible parties
- Specify measurable indicators of success
