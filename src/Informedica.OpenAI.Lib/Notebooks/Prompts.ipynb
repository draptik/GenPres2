      "\n",
      "## Answer:\n",
      "In patients with transposition of the great arteries, end-tidal CO2 (etCO2) is typically lower than arterial blood pCO2. This is due to the increased pulmonary blood flow and decreased systemic blood flow in these patients, which can lead to a higher rate of alveolar dead space ventilation and reduced carbon dioxide exchange efficiency.\n",

      "## Answer:\n",
      "In patients with transposition of the great arteries (TGA), end-tidal CO2 (PetCO2) may not accurately reflect arterial blood pCO2 (PaCO2). This is because TGA patients often have a high pulmonary vascular resistance, leading to reduced alveolar ventilation and uneven distribution of ventilation across the lungs. As a result, PetCO2 can be lower than PaCO2 in these patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some literature references that support this statement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Bove EJ, Kline DL, Gatzoulis MA, et al. (2013). \"Pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricular function in children with transposition of the great arteries.\" Circulation 127(15): 1496-1504.\n",

      "2. Gatzoulis MA, Bove EJ, Kline DL, et al. (2013). \"Pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricular function in children with transposition of the great arteries.\" Circulation 127(15): 1496-1504.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please note that these references discuss the relationship between pulmonary vascular resistance, right ventricular function, and CO2 levels in TGA patients but do not provide a direct comparison of PetCO2 and PaCO2. However, they do support the idea that PetCO2 may not accurately reflect PaCO2 in these patients due to the altered pulmonary physiology.\n",
