      "The sky appears blue to us because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight passes through Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with the molecules and particles in the air. These interactions cause the shorter wavelength colors (like violet and blue) to scatter more than the longer wavelength colors (like red and yellow).\n",
      "\n",
      "Our eyes are most sensitive to blue light, so we perceive the sky as blue when we look up at it. However, during sunrise and sunset, the sunlight has to travel through a larger portion of the atmosphere, causing even more scattering and allowing the longer wavelength colors (like reds and oranges) to dominate, resulting in the beautiful colors we see during these times.\n",
